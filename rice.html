      <h1>Evaluating this idea</h2>
      
      
      <h2>Reach</h2>
      
      <p>High:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>1 in 5 households in the UK rent</li>
        <li>860,000 households who rent moved in the year 2016 to 2017</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2016-to-2017-private-rented-sector">English Housing Survey 2016-17</a></p>
      
      <p>Assumption: a high proportion of households moving need to provide evidence of income when they begin a new tenancy.</p>
      
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      
      <p>Strong:</p>
      
      <p>Reduces the amount of personal data tenants have to share.</p>
      
      <p>Reduces processing time and cost for landlords and estate agents.</p>
      
      <h2>Confidence</h2>
      
      <p>Medium:</p>
      
      <p>Some good data backing up assumptions (English Housing Survey), but no user research to validate need or willingness to adopt a solution like this.</p>
      
      <h2>Effort</h2>
       
      <p>Medium:</p>
        
      <p>Technical infrastructure exists in services like View or share your driving licece information.</p>
        <p>There may be policy or legal issues.</p>
